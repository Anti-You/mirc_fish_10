"FiSH 10" - a blowfish encryption plug-in for mIRC 7,
  compatible to previous FiSH scripts and other clients!

This is an encryption addon for mIRC, it is based on FiSH v1.30 and is compatible to the
original 'blowcrypt/bloW' script as well as Mircryption and other clients.
It supports private chat, channel, topic encryption and comes with a secure key-exchange
system (DH1080).

Supported mIRC versions: mIRC 7 only!
	You can download the latest beta from www.mirc.com/beta.html

== INSTALLING ==

	Don't shy away, the guide below is just verbose, installing is easy!

	Installing should be pretty straightforward as patching mirc.exe is no longer required.
	If you have been using FiSH.dll before, it is however strongly recommended that
	you restore mirc.exe to its unpatched, original state before you install FiSH 10.
	You can of course apply a "crack" after that, but mIRC is a good product, so if you use
	it every day, you should just consider getting a legit lifetime license.

	Alright, now on to the actual installing procedure. If you have not been using FiSH.dll
	before, or if you are installing mIRC 7 from scratch, you can skip this paragraph.
		- Unload FiSH.mrc from mIRC like so: //unload -rs $shortfn($nofile($mircexe) $+ FiSH.mrc)
		(- Unload blow.mrc, blowcrypt.mrc, mircryption.mrc, etc.)
		- Delete FiSH.dll
		- Delete FiSH.mrc
		(- Delete DH.dll blowfish.dll bloW.dll)
		- Keep! blow.ini

	Now that your mIRC installation is clean, we can move on to the actual installing part.
		- Download the latest zip file from http://github.com/flakes/mirc_fish_10/downloads
			(if you haven't already)
		- Shut down mIRC!
		- Extract fish_10.dll, fish_inject.dll and fish_10.mrc to your mirc.exe folder.
			Do the same with libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll if your download contains them.
		- You can edit fish_10.mrc if your blow.ini is at a different location than that folder.
			This is useful for people who installed mIRC into Program Files but keep their settings
			in the Users/AppData folder.
		- Start mIRC back up. If your mIRC is automatically connecting on startup, you might
			have to turn that off, or add a timer. It is extremely important that fish_10.mrc
			gets loaded before ANY IRC connection is being made.
		- Install the script: //load -rs $shortfn($nofile($mircexe) $+ fish_10.mrc)
		- Shut down mIRC, and start it again
		- Two lines like this should show up (and no error popup):
			*** FiSH 10 *** by [c&f] *** fish_inject.dll compiled XXX XX 2010 12:00:00 ***
			*** FiSH 10 *** by [c&f] *** fish_10.dll     compiled XXX XX 2010 12:00:00 ***
		- If that is the case, FiSH 10 is now ready for action!
		- Connect to your networks and do your thing.

	When mIRC updates, FiSH 10 should just continue to work in 99% of the cases, unlike
	the previous solution. And it's open source, pretty cool, he?

	You can report bugs at http://github.com/flakes/mirc_fish_10/issues
	or ask for help in the old FiSH.dll's forums: http://fish.secure.la/forum/
	Please don't message me on IRC.

	If you are an IRC freak like me, you should also check out ZNC, the best bouncer
	software available: http://en.znc.in/wiki/ZNC

	FiSH 10 does not contain any specialiced code for decrypting psyBNC or sBNC logs.
	Why should it? ZNC's buffers play back just fine, including appended (not prepended)
	time stamps.

== ABOUT ==

	fish_10.mrc is a 1:1 copy of FiSH.mrc, with some modifications to account for proper
	Windows Vista and 7 support and to facilitate DLL loading.

	I would like to thank RXD for the work he has put into the FiSH addon over the last
	few years. However, he has been slow with updates and unwilling to open source a
	simple add-on like this, so someone had to take over at least the mIRC addon.

	FiSH 10 also uses CPatch by armagedescu, thanks. It contains some code from
	http://dirtirc.sourceforge.net/ (blowfish core) and some utility methods from
	http://code.google.com/p/infekt/ (which is an excellent NFO viewer by the way).
	The rest of the code is what I contributed myself and is licensed under the
	"Go fuck yourself, it's free!" license.

== TECHNICAL ==

	FiSH 10 makes heavy use of OpenSSL. It is recommended that you use the SSL libs
	(ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll) that come with the download, but other recent
	libraries should work too. If they don't, FiSH 10 will let you know on startup.

	You can read some lines about the in-memory patching in fish-inject.cpp. fish_inject.dll
	(compiled from fish-inject.cpp, patcher.cpp and socket.cpp) does the magic of intercepting
	the system calls and managing buffers. For complete lines, it calls into fish_10.dll which
	does the actual IRC parsing and encryption things.
	Key-exchange, getting the "outside" IP etc. is still being handled by fish_10.mrc, like it
	has always been.

== SECURITY NOTE ==

	You are advised to use TrueCrypt or a similar solution to protect the blow.ini file. While all the
	keys are stored encrypted, the encryption is not particularly strong and could be broken without
	a lot of effort!

	Furthermore, DON'T exchange keys via plaintext (IRC/email/Facebook/whatever). This defeats the
	entire purpose of the encryption. Instead, use DH1080 key exchange to establish a secure channel
	for (channel) key exchange.
